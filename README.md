It's short for Dr. Docherty.

Heather asked me to make a website where people could upload photos and videos of
their time with Richard. This website is an attempt to dry-fire the new `brevity`
template and build a library around s3 pre-signed urls. Wish it was a bit more 
fun-spirited, but as far as I'm concerned, it's an honor to build this for Richard.
